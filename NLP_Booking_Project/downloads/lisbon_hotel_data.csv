Here, where history stays for tomorrow, we do everything we can to honor your preference, and turn your dreams into an unforgettable journey.

STORYTELLING
Sitting at his dispatch table, in dim light so as not to completely wake up reality and time, is the Governor over the centuries that have passed and the centuries to come. Always with the Torre de Belém in sight, opening the way for MAAT's new currents.

With the pose of who is promptly waiting for someone, his imponent figure is clad in a cobalt blue jacket from which the cuffs and collars, literally immaculate, metaphorically free, escape.

Over the collars hangs a smiling face. With the humility of someone who forgets the ornaments that weigh on his chest - which make him live slightly leaning forward; with the curiosity for the future and the unknown of every second and centimeter of the world to be explored - and makes him live leaning significantly forward.

It's this smile that announces what he's going to say as soon as he approaches a guest: - What an honor to have you in my home, which is also yours. And you've come at just the right time. This space of ours, where history stays for the future, is perfect for sharing an adventure. It happened to me just yesterday. Or will it happen tomorrow? But first, let's have a gin with pink Indian pepper in the garden's tranquility, as I know you like, while they prepare our sushi, which is even fresher than in the Land of the Rising Sun.

Built in the former home of the Governor of the Belém Tower, exquisitely restored over Roman remains, probably dating from the 1st to 5th centuries, Palácio do Governador - Lisbon Hotel & SPA is a place of all times. But this place is more than just a hotel, it is a legacy of our history that is preparing for a new stage in the future, inviting you to experience a unique present. Honoring you.

FACTS
Palácio do Governador – Lisbon Hotel & SPA has 60 rooms, all different, next to the river, in the historic centre of Belém, in one of the most beautiful and emblematic areas of the capital. Surrounded by national historical monuments, it's the natural choice for those who want to be in Lisbon, close to everything, from culture to leisure and far enough away to feel tranquillity. The Belém Tower is just a few steps away.

The hotel has two outdoor pools - one for adults and one for children, an area with bali beds and a poolside bar that supports the main bar.

Po Tat Restaurant - From the combination of the vibrant flavors of Pan-Asian cuisine and the adventurous spirit of 15th century Portuguese travelers came Po Tat (the name given to the Chinese tart inspired by the pastel de nata). The restaurant draws inspiration from centuries of Portuguese exploration to bring new techniques and reinvent flavors crossing Japan, China and Korea. At Po Tat tradition and innovation meet in a wave of flavours and each dish, prepared by Chef André Santos, is a culinary journey that transcends borders. You can't miss the chance to stamp this gastronomic experience in your travel passport.

Belém BarTolomeu Bar – A bar with the soul of an explorer, inspired on the explorer Bartolomeu Dias, and offering light meals in a symbiosis of three great cuisines, Asian, Portuguese and Mediterranean, with signature cocktails, where we toast to the spirit of exploration and the rich tapestry of cultures that make our world so wonderfully diverse. The menu also dazzles with the freshest flavors from the land and sea, which are a real provocation to the senses. All these flavors will transport you to another universe. The outdoor terrace is also the perfect place to enjoy a sunset with a cocktail in hand to the sound of the latest beats.

For those seeking rejuvenation, Felicitás Spa Governador is a 1200 sqm sanctuary with treatments aimed at promoting relaxation and revitalization. Guests and visitors can indulge in massages, facials, and therapies that combine premium products and skilled techniques, ensuring a tranquil escape from everyday stresses. Unwind with amenities such as: indoor pool with two waterfalls, caribbean shower storm, ice fountain, turkish bath, sauna, relaxation area and gym.
